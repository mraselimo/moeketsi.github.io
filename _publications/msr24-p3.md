###### Abstract
Identifying and fixing bugs in programs remains a challenge and is one of the most time-consuming tasks in software development. But even after a bug is identified, and a fix has been proposed by a developer or tool, it is not uncommon that the fix is incomplete and does not cover all possible inputs that trigger the bug. This can happen quite often and leads to re-opened issues and inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce P3, a curated dataset composed of incomplete fixes. Each entry in the set contains a series of commits fixing the same underlying issue, where multiple of the intermediate commits are incomplete fixes. These are sourced from real-world open-source C projects. The selection process involves both automated and manual stages. Initially, we employ heuristics to identify potential partial fixes from repositories, subsequently we validate them through meticulous manual inspection. This process ensures the accuracy and reliability of our curated dataset. We envision that the dataset will support researchers while investigating partial fixes in more detail, allowing them to develop new techniques to detect and fix them. We make our dataset publicly available at https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/research/data/partial-fix-dataset.
