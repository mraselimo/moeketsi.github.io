headline: My MSc has been upgraded to a PhD

I passed my upgrade proposal from MSc to a PhD program. One step
closer to getting the P. This happened during the first 
week of hard lockdown in South Africa due to covid-19. Everyone 
was still figuring out this work from home thing. It was 
really tough is an understatement.
